Working through a Remote 'Bastion' or 'Jump' Host
=================================================

In the case the Broker Services are running in a private & secured subnet, using a bastion host as an indirection may provide a solution.

Here, we explore the following setup and how the inventory and playbooks using Ansible Solace may be structured to support this setup:

- 2 or more VPCs running Broker Services, both with a ``Bastion Host``
  - either self-hosted (Figure 1) or with Solace Cloud (Figure 2)
- configured from a single point, the ``Ansible Controller``

The flow inside a playbook is as follows:

- Ansible logs into the ``Bastion Host`` via ssh (e.g. using a private key)
- Ansible transfers the ``Solace module`` to the ``Bastion Host`` and executes it there
- the ``Solace module`` running on the ``Bastion Host`` uses HTTPS to communicate via SEMP with the individual ``Broker Service Instances``
- the ``Solace module`` writes it's log files to a defined directory on the ``Bastion Host``
- after successful execution and in case of any errors, the ``log files`` are transferred back to the ``Ansible Controller``

This mechanism also allows for the creation of bridges & DMR clusters between ``Broker Service Instances`` across ``VPCs`` - using the same playbook.

Setting up the ``Bastion Host``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Ansible scripts are executed on the ``Bastion Host``. It therefor needs to be setup with the following:

- Python 3 (upgrade pip3 as well)
- Python dependencies :download:`requirements <../../examples/requirements.txt>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/requirements.txt

Note: there is no need to install Ansible or Ansible Solace Collection on the ``Bastion Host``.


Inventory & Playbook Example
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Consider the following inventory file that describes two ``Bastion Hosts`` with two ``Broker Service Instances``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   all:
     hosts:
       broker-service-1:
         # args for the bastion host
         ansible_become: true
         ansible_host: {ip-address-of-bastion-host-vpc-1}
         ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
         ansible_user: {ansible-user-on-bastion-host}
         ansible_solace_log_base_path: /var/local
         # args for the solace modules
         broker_type: solace_cloud
         sempv2_host: {fqdns-or-ip-of-semp-service-of-broker-service}
         sempv2_is_secure_connection: true
         sempv2_password: {password}
         sempv2_port: 943
         sempv2_timeout: '60'
         sempv2_username: {username}
         solace_cloud_service_id: {the-service-id}
         virtual_router: primary
         vpn: broker-service-1
       broker-service-2:
         # args for the bastion host
         ansible_become: true
         ansible_host: {ip-address-of-bastion-host-vpc-2}
         ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
         ansible_user: {ansible-user-on-bastion-host}
         ansible_solace_log_base_path: /var/local
         # args for the solace modules
         broker_type: solace_cloud
         sempv2_host: {fqdns-or-ip-of-semp-service-of-broker-service}
         sempv2_is_secure_connection: true
         sempv2_password: {password}
         sempv2_port: 943
         sempv2_timeout: '60'
         sempv2_username: {username}
         solace_cloud_service_id: {the-service-id}
         virtual_router: primary
         vpn: broker-service-2

The following playbook will create a the same queue on both ``Broker Service Instance`` in both VPCs.
It also shows an example of how to fetch the log files from the ``Bastion Hosts`` back to the ``Ansible Controller`` regardless of success or error using an ``Ansible handler``.

.. code-block:: yaml

  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  any_errors_fatal: true
  collections:
    - solace.pubsub_plus
  module_defaults:
    # ... define additional module defaults
    solace_queue:
      host: "{{ sempv2_host }}"
      port: "{{ sempv2_port }}"
      secure_connection: "{{ sempv2_is_secure_connection }}"
      username: "{{ sempv2_username }}"
      password: "{{ sempv2_password }}"
      timeout: "{{ sempv2_timeout }}"
      msg_vpn: "{{ vpn }}"
  vars:
      # adding the inventory_hostname to log file.
      # resulting in: /var/local/my-solace-cloud-service.ansible-solace.log
      remote_ansible_solace_log_path: "{{ ansible_solace_log_base_path }}/{{ inventory_hostname }}.ansible-solace.log"
  environment:
    # set the environment for the playbook to enable logging
    ANSIBLE_SOLACE_ENABLE_LOGGING: true
    ANSIBLE_SOLACE_LOG_PATH: "{{ remote_ansible_solace_log_path }}"
  handlers:
    # define a handler to retrieve the log file to the ansible controller vm
  - name: Bring back the log file
    fetch:
      src: "{{ remote_ansible_solace_log_path }}"
      # variable set when calling the playbook. NOTE the '/' at the end!
      dest: "{{ ANSIBLE_SOLACE_LOCAL_LOG_BASE_PATH }}/"
      flat: yes
    listen: log-file-handler
    no_log: true
  tasks:
    # ensure the handler is notified at least once
  - name: Set up Handler
    debug:
      msg: setup handler
    changed_when: true
    notify: log-file-handler
  - name: Delete Log file
    file:
      path: "{{ remote_ansible_solace_log_path }}"
      state: absent

  - name: Block of ansible-solace tasks
    block:
    - name: Create Queue
      solace_queue:
        name: my-queue
        state: present
    always:
      # ensure handlers are called no matter if a task inside the block fails or not
      - meta: flush_handlers
